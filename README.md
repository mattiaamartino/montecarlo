# Montecarlo Methods

I used the montecarlo method applied to different areas. 

In montecarlo_integral.py you find an approximation of a function integral

In roulette.py you find simulations of a game of roulette (french version, with analysis of color or number choice). For this part I averaged out some iteration outcomes in order to check how much you loose (average) compared to how much you play. Essetially the casino always wins in the long term (also if you play just 5 times per iteration).

In montecarlo_estimation.py you find the montecarlo method used to find the use of the montecarlo estimator to find the linear coefficient a random vector, but it is incomplete, since it is missing the model to estimate the slope of the line -I didn't finish my course in stats yet :(.
